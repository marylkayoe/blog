And it does, poor github actions has to do all the heavy lifting… insane, to install a linux distro just to run a script that posts a file to a website. But hey, to get cat posts as fast as possible, it’s worth it, i guess.</p><!----> <!--[--><ul><p><strong>Tags:</strong> nerding out, testing</p></ul><!--]--></article><article style="margin-bottom: 2rem; padding: 1rem; border: 1px solid #ccc;"><h3>Sat Apr 12 2025</h3> <h2>Yes, she knows</h2>  <!----><p>There’s this weird notion going around. That, supposedly, dogs understand they are dogs and humans are humans, but cats allegedly just think we humans are massively incompetent cats. That’s why they are supposedly bringing us mice as if we needed to learn how to hunt.</p> <p>That’s totally bonkers. No, I can’t claim to know what it feels like to be a cat or what cat thinks, but come on. The absolutely first cognitive capacity any organism that does not reproduce itself by cloning must acquire is the skill of distinguishing whether something is a conspecific (i.e. something to mate with) or not.</p> <p>Humans are  probably the only animals having a problem to deal with the fact that other species are not us.</p> <p>What prompted this post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Catbehavior/comments/1ipvcqq/study_suggests_your_cat_doesnt_see_you_as_a_human" rel="nofollow">Study suggests your cat doesn’t see you as a human, just a really incompetent, oversized cat.</a> - yeah it’s a shitpost. Annoying anyway, like it was the previous round it emerged on the nets : <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/scientist-cats-think-you-are-just-a-big-stupid-cat/" rel="nofollow">Scientist: Cats think you are just a big, stupid cat</a> . There was even a fake video supposedly decoding visual cortex of cats watching humans and the result looked like a cat …</p><!----> <!--[--><ul><p><strong>Tags:</strong> coffee thoughts, just sayin', cats</p></ul><!--]--></article><article style="margin-bottom: 2rem; padding: 1rem; border: 1px solid #ccc;"><h3>Sat Apr 12 2025</h3> <h2>Testing Snippets</h2>  <!----><p>Just learning to use VSCode snippets.</p><!----> <!--[--><ul><p><strong>Tags:</strong> testing, snippets</p></ul><!--]--></article><article style="margin-bottom: 2rem; padding: 1rem; border: 1px solid #ccc;"><h3>Mon Mar 17 2025</h3> <h2>Droppings</h2>  <!----><p>I hate it when I’m walking and a bird poops on me. It’s like, “Hey, I’m just trying to get to work, and you’re just flying around, pooping on people. What’s your problem?”  (this paragraph was written by an ai, jfyi, when I opened up the editor it really was so eager to get started on this post, and I was like, “okay, go ahead, write something,” and it was like, “okay, here’s a paragraph about bird poop,” and I was like, “okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’ll just keep it in here, because why not, right?“)</p> <p>The same feeling when I read people writing how “a new version of (a thing) just dropped” or “(a company) just dropped a new product - it’s a game changer”.  Why am I supposed to have positive feelings about things that clearly are falling around like poop pellets from a sheep? It gives the (most likely) false notion that no humans were involved in managing to push the thing into “production”.</p> <p>What prompted this post: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-report-earth-sea-level-rise" rel="nofollow">NASA dropped a new report. It’s a wake-up call.</a>. Sounds like a wake-up call if NASA just drops things from their back end.</p><!----> <!--[--><ul><p><strong>Tags:</strong> coffee thoughts, just sayin', just asking questions</p></ul><!--]--></article><!--]--><!----><!----><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
