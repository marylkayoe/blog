I hate it when I'm walking and a bird poops on me. It's like, "Hey, I'm just trying to get to work, and you're just flying around, pooping on people. What's your problem?"  (this paragraph was written by an ai, jfyi, when I opened up the editor it really was so eager to get started on this post, and I was like, "okay, go ahead, write something," and it was like, "okay, here's a paragraph about bird poop," and I was like, "okay, that's fine, I guess, I'll just keep it in here, because why not, right?")

The same feeling when I read people writing how "a new version of (a thing) just dropped" or "(a company) just dropped a new product - it's a game changer".  Why am I supposed to have positive feelings about things that clearly are falling around like poop pellets from a sheep? It gives the (most likely) false notion that no humans were involved in managing to push the thing into "production".
